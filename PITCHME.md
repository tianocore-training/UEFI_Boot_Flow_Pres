- Firmware Volume (FV) 
  - The basic storage with a firmware device
- Firmware File System (FFS)
  - Describes the organization of files within a FV

Note:
-A Firmware Volume (FV) is a logical firmware device. The basic storage <br>
repository for data and/or code is the firmware volume. Each firmware volume is organized into a
file system. As such, the file is the base unit of storage for firmware

-Firmware Volume (FV) <br>
A firmware file system (FFS) describes the organization of files and (optionally) free space within
the firmware volume. Each firmware file system has a unique GUID, which is used by the firmware
to associate a driver with a newly exposed firmware volume

Note:
PEI Function <Br>
- PEI Primary goals:
  -	Discover boot mode (Normal, S3, Recovery)
  - Discover and initialize some RAM that wonât be reconfigured
  -	Discover location of FV(s) containing DXE Core & Architecture Protocols and Launch DXE core

- PEI Phases â 
   - Pre â memory Init
   - Memory reference code (MRC)
   - Post Memory Init

Components: 
- Binaries: PEI Core and PEI Modules (PEIMs)
PEIMs are modules scheduled by the PEI core in the early phase of platform initialization. PEIMs are typically executed in place before system memory is available. 
- On IA running in No Eviction mode (NEM) aka.  Cache as RAM

Interfaces: Methods of Inter-PEIM communication
Core set of services (PeiServices), PEIM to PEIM Interfaces (PPIs), and simple Notifies (no timer in PEI)

@title[UEFI Boot Flow DXE]
#### <p align="center"><span class="gold"   >UEFI - PI & EDK II Boot Flow </span><span style="color:white;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>DXE</b> </span></p>

Note:
DXE - EFI System Table<Br>
UEFI system table passed into your driver

It contains a pointer the System Configuration table  - This is an array of GUID Pointer pairs -  you can see the DXE Services table â The HOBs so for example if you have a PEIM that produces some data âand produces a GUIDed HOB this is how you would get the pointer to that HOBs â other examples 

The UEFI System table also has fields in it that point to the active consoles  - Input Console â Output Console â These would be used for the âPrintfâ i.e. Debug mechanism you  can use the Error console 
 UEFI Boot Services Table â we will go through these â this is boot services and goes away once the OS is booted so 
The Handle database  - that is maintained by the dxe core â The handle data base contains all the pointers to all the protocols that all the drivers produce. 

There are some protocols and handler services that if you have a DXE Driver that produces a  Protocol and that protocol needs to be accessed by other drivers than this is the mechanism to access other protocols â it is a boot services to access protocols thus you know to go to the boot services table definition and look at the boot services available to find which protocol you need or which protocol you need to produce.

The next table pointed to by the UEFI system services table is the UEFI Runtime Services Table â With these services you can access services to variables to read/write â access the real time clock â 
Run time services have to persist after the OS runtime and these services are still available.
The system configuration table you can see is still available even after the OS boots. 
However, recall that these are an array of GUID pointer pairs and that the GUID â so the GUID and pointer will persist but if you have a dependency of those GUIDS back into the  DXE boot services table it will not be valid at Runtime.  

Some additional fields VERSION Information â (not services specifically) â Information that is maintained during Runtime

Summary -
So that is how the UEFI system table points to many different Services and Data structures within the Firmware â and will be used by your drivers

The DXE core produces the UEFI System Table, and the UEFI System Table is used by every DXE driver and executable image invoked later on in the BDS phase. It contains all the information needed to utilize the services provided by the DXE core, and the services provided by any previously loaded DXE driver.
The DXE core produces the UEFI Boot Services, UEFI Runtime Services, and DXE Services using the architectural protocols that was produced by the DXE drivers. The UEFI System Table provides access to all the active console devices in the platform.  It provides access to UEFI Configuration Tables. The UEFI Configuration Tables contains more tables such as DXE Services, HOB List, ACPI, SMBIOS, and the SAL System Table. This list can also be expanded in the future.
Also included, is the handle database. Any executable image can access the handle database for any of the protocol interfaces that have been registered by DXE drivers. 
When the transition to the OS runtime is performed, the handle database, active consoles, UEFI Boot Services, and services provided by boot service DXE drivers are terminated. This frees up more memory for use by the OS, and leaves the UEFI System Table, UEFI Runtime Services Table, and the system configuration tables available in the OS runtime environment. 
There is also the option of converting all of the UEFI Runtime Services from a physical address space to an OS-specific virtual address space. This address space conversion may only be performed once. 

Letâs take a quick look at the end product of Frameworkâthe tables that Framework will create for UEFI aware Operating systems.   They are implemented by the drivers dispatched during the DXE phase.  As specified by the UEFI spec, there are boot-time services and runtime services.  There is a handle database and a list of all the protocols that these handles have associated with them.  Of course, keep in mind that all these will be gone from memory when the OS has booted.  The only things that will remain are the runtime services.

Note:
Device Path and Global Variables<Br>
The use of device paths allows the system resources to be defined in terms of connections between hardware devices, and the âpathwaysâ the processor must follow to get to those devices.  

This includes the pathway to a specific boot device.

In the Example: 
The Boot target is the OS loader UEFI Application located on the third partition of the Master drive on the primary ATA controller off of the PCI Device 1Fh, function #1, off of the primary PCI host bridge (Bus zero).   This is how we would refer to this target, starting form the target working back to the processor, in UEFI, the target is defined starting from the processor, as devices are discovered and drivers are loaded in the boot process.  

Starting from the beginning, The initialization of the PCI Root Bridge is a one of the fundamental steps in system initialization,   Many hardware components are attached to the PCI bus, and this step is necessary to discover all subsequent devices on the PCI bus.  In the example, the PNP ID found is associated with the Root PCI device in the system (the Northbridge/Southbridge pair, or the equivalent).  This establishes the basis of PCI BUS zero and the root for additional PCI devices (and buses).

On PCI Bus zero, there exists (device 1Fh, Function 1) and IDE controller.  This device discovered and initialized by a driver to initialize PCI devices.  Note: this process is part of PCI initialization, it initialized the controller, but is not concerned with any âchildrenâ devices attached (downstream) to the controller, this will be handled later.

The devices on the IDE controller are now being initialized.  An ATA driver is associated with the drives, and the the Primary Master disk drive is now initialized.  

This occurs at the same time the system consoles are established (near boot device select timeframe).  This is important, as the HDD will not be initialize in the Pre-boot flow, unless it is the current âTargeted Boot Deviceâ or the user has selected âSetupâ as the boot path.

If the HDD is the Current targeted device, then it has to be initialized to be able to use for boot (obviously).  However, if the system does not need the device to attempt the boot, then it will not waste time initializing a device that is not necessary.

In the case of setup, the system is not âbootingâ to an OS, but rather the user is configuring the systems options.  It is therefore necessary for all system options (hardware) to be initialized, so the user has a complete and accurate inventory to work with in the configuration process.

The drive was initialized in the last step, but drives may contain several partitions (in this case, the partition of interest is Partition 3), so a partition driver is associated to point to the proper partition on the drive.

The final stage in following the path, is to access the files on the target partition and load the Boot loader program.  

File access is handled by a File system driver, which has to be initialized for the drive and partition targeted (Primary Master ATA, Partition #3).  Once initialized, the file structure can be parsed, the the boot loader file (OSLoader.efi) can be loaded into memory and executed.  

This begins the launch of the OS, and the transition state for the boot firmware to the operating system.

However, now that the process is underway, there is still the software process of booting the OS.  The OS loader will ensure that the system is capable of booting the OS by running diagnostics (at least to ensure that the OS image on the disk is viable to boot an OS).  IF the diagnostics fail, the OS loader can return the system to the firmware, to allow it to attempt to boot from the next boot target in the list of âbootable devicesâ.

Assuming a complete and successful execution of Diagnostics, the OS loader will load the OS code, and the Boot process will complete as part of the OSâs function.

This Boot of the operating system was initiated, and successful, starting from a a simple path defining the device (location) from which to boot, and ending with a viable OS execution on the platfrom.

System Management Mode (SMM) describes a Processor operating mode which services the high priority System Management Interrupt (SMI)
- Upon SMI, Processor will switch into SMM
- Jump to a pre-defined entry vector
- Create a âsave stateâ such that execution can be resumed upon exit of SMM
- Generated by software or by a hardware event
- Each SMI source can be detected, cleared and disabled.
- Special memory (SMRAM) is set aside for SMM software
- Usually the SMRAM is locked after initialization so that it cannot be exposed until the next system reset. 

- Registration vehicle for dispatching drivers in response to SMI
- Dispatch of drivers in SMM will not be able to use core protocol services 
- SMM handlers will be logically precluded from accessing conventional memory resources 
- SmmLib includes a subset of the DXE core services, such as memory allocation, device I/O protocol, and others

Note:
TheÂ IntelÂ® Firmware Support Package (IntelÂ® FSP)Â is a royalty-free option for initializing Intel silicon, designed for integration into a boot loader of the developer's choice. It is easy to adopt, is scalable to design, reduces time to market, and is economical to build. Intel FSP provides a binary package to initialize the processor, memory controller, and IntelÂ® chipset initialization functions.
Intel FSP is designed for integration into a variety of boot loaders, including coreboot and TianoCore (open source Unified Extensible Firmware Interface [UEFI]).

#### <p align="center"><span class="gold"   >Boot Flow with UEFI & IntelÂ® FSP</span></p>

Note:
Platform Initialization (PI) & UEFI w/ EDK <Br>
- Intel FSP boot flow    

The normal boot flow of FSP2.0 is shown on this slide. In normal boot, the SecPlatformLib (sample at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/Library/SecFspWrapperPlatformSecLibSample ), which is linked by the SecCore (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/UefiCpuPkg/SecCore ), calls first FSP API â TempRamInitApi, and then transfers the control to the PeiCore. SecPlatformLib also registers SecTempRamDonePpi (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/Library/SecFspWrapperPlatformSecLibSample/SecTempRamDone.c ) for TempRamExitApi. 
One platform PEIM is responsible to detect the current boot mode and finds some variables (like capsule variable) to finalize the boot mode selection. The FspmWrapperPeim (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/FspmWrapperPeim ) has a dependency on MasterBootModePpi, so after the boot mode is determined, the FspmWrapperPeim is invoked. FspmWrapperPeim gets the UPD data, allocates buffer for UPD override data, then calls UpdateFspmUpdData() to update the UPD data according to platform policy (sample at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/Library/BaseFspWrapperPlatformLibSample ). Then FspmWrapperPeim calls second FSP API â FspMemoryInitApi. Once this API returns, FspmWrapperPeim calls PostFspmHobProcess() to process the initial FSP HOB. (sample at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/Library/PeiFspWrapperHobProcessLibSample ). FspWrapperHobProcessLib parses resource HOB and installs PEI memory to PEI core. 
Once the PeiCore gets permanent memory, PeiCore does TemporaryRam migration and calls PeiTemporaryRamDonePpi, where TempRamExitApi is called. After that, PeiCore installs PeiMemoryDiscovered. Then the dependency of FspsWrapperPeim (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/FspsWrapperPeim ) is satisfied. FspsWrapperPeim gets the UPD data, allocates buffer for UPD override data, then calls UpdateFspsUpdData() to update the UPD data according to platform policy. (sample at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/Library/BaseFspWrapperPlatformLibSample ). Then FspsWrapperPeim calls FspSiliconInitApi to finish final silicon initialization. Once this API returns, FspsWrapperPeim calls PostFspsHobProcess() to process FSP HOB after silicon initialization. (sample at https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/Library/PeiFspWrapperHobProcessLibSample ). Typically, there will be more data in the FSP HOB at this time. Most work in PostFspsHobProcess() is to migrate the HOB data from FSP to FspWrapper. 
Then the PeiCore will continue dispatching the final PEIMs and jump into the DxeCore. Then the DxeCore launches FspWrapperNotifyDxe (https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/IntelFsp2WrapperPkg/FspWrapperNotifyDxe ). FspWrapperNotifyDxe registers a callback function for the last FSP API â FspNotifyApi, for AfterPciEnumeration, ReadyToBoot, and EndOfFirmware.

Note:

Stable Tag releases are validated snapshots of EDK II adding updates and new key features  and bug fixes


There is a development phase, 
Soft Feature Freeze
The soft feature freeze is the beginning of the stabilization phase of edk2's development process. By the date of the soft feature freeze, developers must have sent their patches to the mailing listÂ andreceived positive maintainer reviews (Reviewed-byÂ orÂ Acked-byÂ tags). This means that features, and in particular non-trivial ones, must have been accepted by maintainers before the soft freeze date.
Between the soft feature freeze and theÂ hard feature freeze, previously reviewed and unit-tested features may be applied (or merged) to the master branch, for integration testing. Feature addition or enablement patches postedÂ orÂ reviewed after the soft feature freeze will be delayed until after the upcomingÂ stable tag.

Note:
The IntelÂ® Firmware Support Package (IntelÂ® FSP) [FSP] provides key programming information for initializing Intel silicon and can be easily integrated into a firmware boot environment of the developerâs choice. 
Different Intel hardware devices may have different Intel FSP binary instances, so a platform user needs to choose the right Intel FSP binary release. The FSP binary should be independent of the platform design but specific to the Intel CPU and chipset complex. We refer to the entities that create the FSP binary as the âFSP Producerâ and the developer who integrates the FSP into some platform firmware as the âFSP Consumer.â 
Despite the variability of the FSP binaries, the FSP API caller (aka FSP consumer) could be a generic module to invoke the 5 APIs defined in FSP EAS (External Architecture Specification) to finish silicon initialization. [FSP EAS] 
The flow below describes the FSP, with the FSP binary from the âFSP Producerâ in green and the platform code that integrates the binary, or the âFSP Consumerâ, in blue.
